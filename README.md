`codexplor` offers R functions for explore and monitor a programming
project : get immediate insights on a programming project with
text-mining metrics, network analysis & dataviz‚Äô. Get rid of complexity
with a broader perspective on the project !

## Installation

You can install the development version of codexplor with

``` r
devtools::install_github("clement-LVD/codexplor")
```

## Features

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/%7BMethod%7D-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=Citations%20Network%20of%20internal%20dependencies&labelColor=black&color=green)

Given a programming project :

‚è© Appreciate global complexity with a **Citations Network of internal
dependencies** - Get network metrics & dataviz‚Äô about the functions
defined in the project (e.g.¬†explore global structure or zoom on major
internal dependancies[^1]).

‚è© Assess local complexity with **Text-mining metrics** *\[WIP\]* - Get
document-level metrics (e.g., files readability)

## Supported languages

Currently `codexplor` support the
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-yellow) programming language. Planned
languages are : R, Python, JavaScript, Java, C, Cpp, Go.

### Example : Explore your internal-dependancies with a Citations Network

1.  Given folders path(s) and/or github repo(s), get a Citations Network
    of the functions with
    ![.](https://img.shields.io/badge/%7BMethod%7D-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get_text_network_from_project()&labelColor=yellow&color=black)

         net <-  get_text_network_from_project(repos = c("tidyverse/stringr", "clement-LVD/codexplor") )
         # Return a data.frame, edgelist of a citations network

2.  Look an interactive dataviz‚Äô with `networkD3` :
    ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/%7BDataviz%7D-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get_networkd3_from_igraph()&labelColor=yellow&color=black)

        codexplor::get_networkd3_from_igraph(net) 

![](man/figures/example_net3d_dataviz.png)

Here, ingoing links are colorized, in order to reveal the functions used
by others functions *aka* local dependancies of the project. e.g.,. we
see that the most-common local dependancy inside the tidyverse/stringr
repo is `compat-types-check.R`, and that some codexplor functions are
relying on stringr:: functions.

Play with the parameters reveal others infos, e.g., you should try to
color nodes accordingly to their outdegrees - the number of functions
they call, in order to reveal the ‚Äúhigh-level functions‚Äô.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

`codexplor` offers several protocols & parameters to take care with. See
the vignettes :

- Apply a precise text-analysis protocol, such as [turning your
  programming project into a
  text-network](../vignettes/Turn%20a%20programming%20project%20into%20a%20text-network)

- [Turn a programming project folder(s) into a corpus with
  construct_corpus()](../vignettes/construct_a_corpus)

- [Turn it into an igraph object, filter and manage it with helper
  functions](../vignettes/manage_igraph_object)

Depending on the languages you have to manage, you‚Äôll want to tweak the
‚Äòpattern‚Äô used for match a function definition. The user must be
familiar with text-mining & network methods since - for now -
`codexplor` only support the R programming language (other languages are
planned).

<!--
‚è© **4. Get an interactive `networkD3` HTML object**
&#10; 
`get_networkd3_from_igraph()` Return a list of 2 objects : 
&#10;1. a list named `'net3d'` with 2 data.frames, with the data used by `networkD3` (`'nodes'` and `'edges'`)
&#10;2. a networkD3::forceNetwork S3 class object named `'forcenetwork'`, an html interactive network dataviz'

<!--
> `codexplor` help you to manage and analyze a programming project, giving you tools to figure out the big picture and to find the little wrench in the (net)work. 
&#10;> **Usecases 1.** As a head of a dozens of persons (non-tech) team', I have to dev' actively on the long run. codexplor help me to get the big picture of a large programming project quickly, with instant metrics & insights. Thanks to the network analysis and dataviz', I have deep insights about the project, such as for identifying theoritical vulnerability, for choosing where to start a polishing loop, but also for following a programming project over the long run. 
&#10;> **Usecases 2.** I can show the network or a small part of the network to the dev' and tech' profiles during our meetings or event prez'.
&#10;> **Usecases 3.** codexplor add insights on a particular function, as an help for the dev' when it come back on a project after a while (e.g., list all the local dependancies of a function and the functions that call it as a local dependancy).
&#10;-->
<!-- *Usecases of a quick programming project understanding*. codexplor goal is to *quickly* analyse your developing project, in order to *gain* time of comprehension, made your documentation, dataviz' of your project, etc. The features offered are crafted for coordinate large programming project, made helper func' for new colleagues and/or future you, formally identifying your higher-level func' and/or the most-frequently used as dependancies... and other handy features for priorizing your work by quickly figure out 'where' you have to pay attention. For example, before to change a parameter name in a func', you want to check what are the func' that used the one you want to modify. Same for changing the returned content or the behavior of a func' : you want to check which ones used this func' that you want to modify. You also want to offer an easy way to understand the chaining of your custom func'. -->
