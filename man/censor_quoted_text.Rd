  text,
  char_for_replacing_each_char = "_",
  suppress_quoting_char = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{A character string containing the text to process.}

\item{char_for_replacing_each_char}{A single character string to be used for replacing
each character in the substring.}

\item{suppress_quoting_char}{Logical. If TRUE, the quoting characters are replaced as well;
if FALSE (default), they are preserved.}

\description{
This function takes a \code{character} string or vector and replaces each character
in each quoted substrings with a replacement character (by default "_"). When
suppress_quoting_char is FALSE (the default), the function preserves the original
opening and closing quotes and only censors the inner content. When TRUE, the quotes
are also replaced.
}
\examples{
# Censor quoted content and keep the quotes:
text <- c("Example: \"Rat-terrier\" (aka 'Teddy Roosevelt Terrier')"
, "have served into a 'Truffe-terrier company'.")
censor_quoted_text(text, char_for_replacing_each_char = "_", suppress_quoting_char = FALSE)
# Remove quoted content and also remove the quotes:
censor_quoted_text(text, char_for_replacing_each_char = "", suppress_quoting_char = TRUE)
}
