```

**`codexplor::construct_corpus`** read programming files and turn a programming project into a text-mining corpus, given :

- folder(s) path(s) and/or github repo(s) to analyze ;
- and programming language(s) (default is `'R'`).

**Supported languages.** By default `construct_corpus` try to read and analyze .R files, but one or several `languages` could be indicated. Recognized languages are `r paste0(names(get_def_regex_by_language()) , collapse = ", ")`. 

## Examples


```{r example, result = 'asis',eval = T}
library(codexplor)

# 1) Construct a corpus without a Citations network
  corp <- construct_corpus( repos =  "clement-LVD/codexplor", languages = "R")
  
  str(corp, max.level = 1) 
  
```

     # Example : several local folders and repos
    corpus <- construct_corpus(c("~", "M:/") languages = "R"
    , repos =  c("clement-LVD/codexplor","tidyverse/stringr"))
   
    # Example : several languages
    corpus_py <- construct_corpus(repos = "secdev/scapy"
    , languages = c("Python", "Javascript"), .verbose = T) #take a while


## Returned list of data.frame
**corpus.list of dataframes.** `construct_corpus` return a `corpus.list` object, a standard `list` of 3 dataframes, i.e. 2 `corpus.lines` and 1 `corpus.nodelist` dataframes. 

Complementary or specific analyzes will add others dataframes to the list, e.g., a network of internal dependancies (classes `citations.network` & `dataframe`).

**Text-mining metrics.** 
Each lines and each documents are associated with text-mining metrics (e.g., number of characters, words count). Within the returned `list` of dataframes, these metrics are relative to : 

- a specific line for the `corpus.lines` dataframes
- or to the entire document for the `corpus.nodelist` `dataframe` .

The `codes` `dataframe` (one of the `corpus.lines` dataframes) have a '`matches`' column. These 1st matches are explained hereafter.

## 1st matches operated
Given language(s), `construct_corpus` try to perform an initial identification within the content. By default, these 1st matches are supposed to be the function names, as soon as a function is defined within a file. For example, if a `pol  <- function` is defined within a file, the 1st `matches` corresponding entry will be `'pol'`.

In order to extract the functions names as a 1st matches, `construct_corpus` rely on some default patterns, associated with the supported languages (see the next section). 


**About duplicated lines associated with 1st matches.**
`construct_corpus` perform a 1st text-extraction, accordingly to a pattern. During this 1st matches extraction, lines are duplicated *when several matches are found on the same line*. This case where several matches are performed on the same lines - and so lines are duplicated - trigger a `warning`. 

> For example, by default, the names of functions defined in the files of the project are extracted during the 1st match operated by `construct_corpus`. If a file have several function defined *within the same line*, such a line will be duplicated in the returned `df`, with several 'matches' entries along these lines and an identical line_number. 

## Default patterns associated with languages
For each of the required language(s), a default standardized patterns is used for :

```{r table-operations-construct-corpus, echo=FALSE}

steps <- data.frame(Step = c("Filter files path/url accordingly to some patterns and read only the selected programming files with the correct extension(s)"  
, "Separate commented lines from *codes lines*"                    
 , "Perform 1st matches within the *codes lines* (default try to extract the functions names)"
, "Refine and post-process the *codes lines*"
)
 , Examples = c('e.g., "R" language is associated with "`.R`" files and a filtering pattern (e.g., files with "`test-`", "`vignettes`", "`Rcheck`" in their full names are excluded)'   
, 'e.g., R & Python files generally have each commented lines that begin with "`#`", others languages should have commented blocks separeted on several lines (e.g., `/* [comments] */`'
  , 'e.g.,  default patterns are crafted for extract the names of the functions defined within a file, e.g., for the R programming language : the name is before a "`<- function(`" instruction'
, "e.g., specifical delimitors of a block of code such as '{' and '}' within a .R file are used to determine if a given 1st match - function definition - is included within another function definition as an inner function (*aka* nested function)"
)

)

colnames(steps) <- c("Steps", "Examples of pattern associated with language(s)")

knitr::kable(steps,row.names = T )

```

> These default patterns are crafted specifically to analyze a programming project in a standardized way, given a programming language.

### Helper functions that rely on `construct_corpus`
`codexplor::get_doc_network_from_project` is an helper 'high-level' function that perform an analysis of the internal dependancies by performing a 2nd matches directly from the 1st matches of `construct_corpus`, e.g., see the [vignette of `get_doc_network_from_project`](https://clement-lvd.github.io/codexplor/articles/vignette_analyse_citations_network_from_project.html).
