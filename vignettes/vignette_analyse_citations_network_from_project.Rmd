This vignette give a basic understanding of the `corpus.list` `list` of dataframes returned by `codexplor::get_doc_network_from_project` : a standard `corpus.list` + an additional `citations.network`, the edgelist of a network of the functions defined in *programming project(s)*.

> `codexplor::get_doc_network_from_project` add a `citations.network` `data.frame` to the `corpus.list` returned by `codexplor::construct_corpus`.

The 1st matches of `codexplor::construct_corpus` reveal some files that *defines* a function, and the 2nd matches of `compute_doc_network_from_corpus` show the files that used these functions. Thus, links are beginning from the programming file that is calling a function => to the programming file where this function is defined. 

See [vignette of `construct_corpus`](https://clement-lvd.github.io/codexplor/articles/vignette_construct_corpus.html) for the 1st matches performed by `construct_corpus`; and the [vignette of the `citations.network` `dataframe`](https://clement-lvd.github.io/codexplor/articles/vignette_citations.network_df_of_internal.dependencies.html) for the 2nd matches.

### Example
Given folders path(s) and/or github repo(s), compute a *citations network* of the functions with ![.](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Method}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get_doc_network_from_project()&labelColor=yellow&color=black)

```{r construct-corpus-and-network, eval = F, echo=TRUE}
require(codexplor)
net <- get_doc_network_from_project(
  repos =  c("tidyverse/stringr", "clement-lvd/codexplor"))
        # by default, codexplor deal with R project

get_networkd3_from_igraph(net$citations.network)
        # Return an interactive dataviz' from networkD3
```


By default, `get_networkd3_from_igraph` will colorize the nodes accordingly to their indegrees. This will reveal the local dependencies of the programming project (i.e. functions used by others files of the project).

*(codexplor functions network is truncated)*

For example, the most-common local dependancy inside the tidyverse/stringr repo is `compat-types-check.R`, [...] and we see that one of the `codexplor` file actually rely on a `stringr`method (i.e. `codexplor::str_extract_all_to_tidy_df.R` rely on `stringr/extract.R`). The opposite is not true.

Playing with the parameters will reveal others insights, e.g., you should try to color nodes accordingly to their outdegrees, in order to reveal the high-level files of the project.

### Crafting your own corpus with codexplor
Depending on the languages you have to manage, you'll want to tweak the 'pattern' used for match a function definition. [xxx link to provide xxx]
