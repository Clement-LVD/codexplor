This Vignette give a basic understanding of the network computed by `codexplor::get_doc_network_from_project` : a Citations Network of functions within *programming project(s)*.

### Example
Given folders path(s) and/or github repo(s), compute a *citations network* of the functions with   ![.](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Method}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get_doc_network_from_project()&labelColor=yellow&color=black)


        net <- get_doc_network_from_project(repos =  c("tidyverse/stringr", "clement-lvd/codexplor"))
        # by default, codexplor deal with R project
        
Then turn this edgelist into an interactive dataviz' with `networkD3` :

        get_networkd3_from_igraph(net$citations_network)
        # Return an interactive dataviz' from networkD3

By default, `get_networkd3_from_igraph` will colorize the nodes accordingly to their indegrees. This will reveal the local dependancies of the programming project (i.e. functions used by others files of the project). 

![.](../man/figures/example_net3d_dataviz.png){width=90%}

*(codexplor functions network is truncated)*

For example, the most-common local dependancy inside the tidyverse/stringr repo is `compat-types-check.R`, [...] and we see that one of the `codexplor` file actually rely on a `stringr`method (i.e. `codexplor::str_extract_all_to_tidy_df.R` rely on `stringr/extract.R`). The opposite is not true.

Playing with the parameters will reveal others insights, e.g., you should try to color nodes accordingly to their outdegrees, in order to reveal the high-level files of the project.

### Network properties
The returned network is a document-to-document citations network. 

These networks have basic properties, not covered here (e.g., a citations network is a directed network).

Regarding the network computed by `codexplor::get_doc_network_from_project()` :

- Nodes are the programming files, default is a network of .R files. 
- Edges go from the file that calls a function to the file where the function is defined.

Thus, in a typical programming project :

- Nodes are files, so mostly - or only - functions ;
- °← Indegree of a file is "how many files are calling the function(s) defined in this file" ;
- °→ Outdegree of a file is "how many functions are used by this file" ; 
- ⟲ Auto-mentioning refear to 'recursivity' (`codexplor` default is to filter autolinks).

### Cascading matching operated by `get_doc_network_from_project`

Assuming the user have indicated folder(s) and/or github repo(s), `codexplor::get_doc_network_from_project()` will try to perform a 'cascading matching' :

⏩ Read the files and extract a 1st pattern, e.g., default are supposed to extract *R functions names as a 1st matches*, e.g., we have defined 'Pier', 'Pol' and 'Jak' - functions - names. 

⏩ Search for these patterns in the initial content, in order to constitute a Citations Network with the 2nd matches, e.g., the content from a programming file is citing 'Pier', 'Pol' and 'Jak'.

🎁 Return the edgelist that symbolize this network of *documents*, by default it's a network of internal dependencies within the files of a programming project.


`codexplor` default pattern are aimed to extract functions names from the files of a *programming* project (links are beginning from the programming file that is calling a function => to the programming file where this function is defined).


### Function call that are non-supported during 2nd matches
Some way of writing a program are not fully supported, such as :

**Python instantiated methods.** The instantiated Python methods are not supported yet by `get_doc_network_from_project`, i.e. `obj.method()`.

If we take this Python code sample, the 1st match is realized by `construct_corpus`, but `get_doc_network_from_project` don't perform a 2nd match.

```{r eval = F }
#  Consider the Python code herafter 
class A:
    def method(self):
        return "My custom method"
 # construct_corpus return 'method' as a 1stly matched function name

obj = A()
obj.method() # Return : 'My custom method'

# get_doc_network_from_project don't identify the 2nd match because of the prefix ("obj.")
```


### Filter undesired match
Junk nodes needs to be excluded from the network. Typical "false positive" matches are the lines where you use the name of another function in a message, e.g. `message("my_func() is deprecated. You should use this_function() instead)`. `get_doc_network_from_project` offer several parameters for dealing with your style of writing a program.


### Crafting your own corpus with codexplor
Depending on the languages you have to manage, you'll want to tweak the 'pattern' used for match a function definition, since for now `codexplor` support only the R programming language (other languages are planned). See the [vignette of `construct_corpus`](https://clement-lvd.github.io/codexplor/articles/vignette_construct_corpus.html).
