# Constructing your corpus
`codexplor` offering functions to turn a bunch of files from a programming project into a corpus and filter it before to process an analysis. 

You should provide folder(s) path(s) and/or github repo(s), and one or several languages to `construct_corpus`

    corpus <- codexplor::construct_corpus("~", "tidyverse/stringr", languages = "R")
    nrow(corpus); length(unique(corpus$matches)) # content + a 1st matched pattern
    
- `construct_corpus` return the full content as a `df`. Some *1st matches* are already realized since the names of functions defined in the files of the project are extracted in a column of the returned `df` (the user is not supposed to define several function in the same line, otherwise lines will be duplicated). 

Indicating a language to `construct_corpus` is needed, e.g., in order to read the programming files accordingly to their extensions. In order to extract the "functions names", `construct_corpus` rely on a regex for each language. Planned languages are :

- `r paste0(collapse = "<br>â€¢ ", names(codexplor::function_def_regex_by_language()))`
