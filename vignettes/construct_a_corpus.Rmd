# Constructing your corpus
`codexplor` offering functions to turn a programming project into a corpus by providing folder(s) path(s) and/or github repo(s). 

    corpus <- codexplor::construct_corpus("~", "tidyverse/stringr", languages = "R")

By default `construct_corpus` is tunned for the R programming language. One or several `languages` could be passed to `construct_corpus`, e.g., in order to read the programming files accordingly to their extensions.
    
- `construct_corpus` return the content as a `df`, comments are wiped (by default)
- *1st matches* are realized accordingly to the pattern provided by the user 
- *1st matches* are extracted in a column of the returned `df`. By default, the names of functions defined in the files of the project are extracted^[If a file have several function defined *within the same line*, lines of the returned `df` will be duplicated.].
- Then, 2 nchar values are computed are computed for each line (nchar and nchar without space).

These default match rely on a regex, for each of the `languages` supported by `construct_corpus`.
