# Constructing your corpus
`codexplor` offering functions to turn a programming project into a corpus by providing folder(s) path(s) and/or github repo(s). 


    corpus <- codexplor::construct_corpus("~", "tidyverse/stringr", languages = "R")
    nrow(corpus); length(unique(corpus$matches)) # content + a 1st matched pattern
 
By default `construct_corpus` is tunned for the R programming language. One or several `languages` could be passed to `construct_corpus`, e.g., in order to read the programming files accordingly to their extensions.
    
- `construct_corpus` return the full content as a `df`. Some *1st matches* are realized : the names of functions defined in the files of the project are extracted in a column of the returned `df`. It's assumed that no file have several function within the same line, otherwise lines of the returned `df` will be duplicated. This matching of functions names rely on a regex, for each of the `languages` supported by `construct_corpus` (i.e. `r paste0(collapse = ", ", names(codexplor:::function_def_regex_by_language()))`).
