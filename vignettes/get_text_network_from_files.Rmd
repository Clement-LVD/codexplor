Assuming you have a bunch of path and/or url from a programming project, `codexplor::get_text_network_from_files()` will compute a Citations Network of your *programming project* :

- the network is directed,
- indegrees of a node is 'how many functions of the project uses this precise func'. 
- Outdegree of a node is "how many functions of the project are used by this precise function". 
- ⟲ auto-mentioning typically reveal 'recursivity', once a func' call itself more than one times (1st mention is usually for define the func' name)


 Assuming the user pass a list of files paths and/or url, `codexplor::get_text_network_from_files()` will :

⏩ Read the files, trying to extract a 1st pattern (e.g., defaults parameters will extract R functions names, when a func' is defined within a file). 
⏩ Search for these patterns (functions names by default) in the initial content, in order to constitute a Citations Network.
- return the edgelist of the network of *documents*.

For example, giving a bunch of .R codes files path and/or url, you should first read all the content and get a network of func' :

    r_fls <- list.files(path = "~", ignore.case = T, all.files = T, full.names = T, recursive = T, pattern = ".R$")

    net <- codexplor::get_text_network_from_files(r_fls,   regex_to_exclude_files_path = "test-")
    # these func' are tunned for detecting R func' by default
    get_networkd3_from_igraph(codexplor::get_igraph_from_df(net) )

There is sometimes a false positive nodes that need to be excluded from the network. Typical "false positive" matches are the lines where you use the name of another function in a message, e.g. `cat("my_func() is deprecated. You should use this_function() instead)`. `get_text_network_from_files` offer several parameters for deal with your style of programming.
