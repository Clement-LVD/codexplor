This vignette explain the network returned by `codexplor::get_text_network_from_project`. This function will compute a Citations Network of *programming project(s)*, from local folder path(s) and/or public github repo(s). This Vignette give a basic understanding of such a network.

### Example
For example, giving a bunch of .R project and/or repos :

    net <- get_text_network_from_project(repos =  c("tidyverse/stringr", "clement-lvd/codexplor"))
    # codexplor functions will deal with a R project by default
    
    # get an igraph object from this edgelist, and optionnaly filter it :
    codexplor::get_igraph_from_df(net) 
    
    #get a networkD3 dataviz' from this edgelist :
    get_networkd3_from_igraph(net)

**Network properties.**
The returned network is a document-to-document Citations network. 

Such a network have already a lot of mathematical properties that we don't cover here (e.g., a Citations Network is always a directed network).

Regarding the network computed by `codexplor::get_text_network_from_project()` :

- A node is one of the programming files (exclusively .R files by default). 
- An edge is symbolizing a link from a file that calls a function to the file where the function is defined.

Thus :

- Indegrees of a node is 'how many functions of the project uses this func'. 
- Outdegree of a node is "how many functions of the project are used by this precise function". 
- ⟲ auto-mentioning typically reveal 'recursivity', once a func' call itself more than one times (1st mention is usually for define the func' name)

### Cascading matching operated
`codexplor` default pattern are aimed to extract functions names from the files of a *programming* project.

Assuming the user have indicated folder(s) and/or github repo(s), `codexplor::get_text_network_from_project()` will try to perform a 'cascading matching' :

⏩ Read the files, trying to extract a 1st pattern (e.g., defaults parameters will extract R functions names, when a func' is defined within a file). 

⏩ Search for these patterns (functions names by default) in the initial content, in order to constitute a Citations Network.

🎁 Return the edgelist of the network of *documents* (i.e. files path with the 2nd match => files path with the 1st match [where the function is defined])

### Filter undesired match
Junk nodes needs to be excluded from the network. Typical "false positive" matches are the lines where you use the name of another function in a message, e.g. `message("my_func() is deprecated. You should use this_function() instead)`. `get_text_network_from_files` offer several parameters for deal with your style of programming.
