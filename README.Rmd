`codexplor` offers R functions for explore and monitor a programming project with text-mining methods : get a deep understanding of the programming project by analyze and visualize it with text-mining metrics, network analysis & dataviz'. 



## Installation
You can install the development version of codexplor with

``` r
devtools::install_github("clement-LVD/codexplor")
```

## Features
- **Appreciate global complexity of a project with a network of internal dependencies.** 
    - **Citations Network** Get metrics & dataviz' about the functions defined in the project (e.g. explore global structure or zoom on major internal dependancies^[functions that are called by others functions of the project]).
- **Assess local complexity with text-Mining metrics.** 
  - Compute document-level metrics (e.g., files readability)
- ...

## Short Example
1. Constitute your 'corpus' of local files and/or urls, eventually from a github repo with ![.](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Method}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get-github-raw-filespath()&labelColor=green&color=black)

2. Compute a Citations Network by passing files path and/or urls to   ![.](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Method}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get-text-network-from-files()&labelColor=yellow&color=black)

3. Get a directed network with `igraph` by passing an edgelist to  ![1.](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Method}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get-igraph-from-df()&labelColor=yellow&color=black)

5. Optionnaly zoom on a precise function with 
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Function}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=filter-igraph-egonetwork()&labelColor=green&color=black)

4. Look at a quick dataviz' with `networkD3` : ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Dataviz}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get-networkd3-from_igraph()&labelColor=yellow&color=black)

## Complete Example 
Hereafter we use the default parameters, dedicated to analyze .R codes files.

‚è© **1. Create a corpus a list of files path and/or url.**

List .R files, from url and/or on your locale machine :

    paths <- list.files(path = "~/", ignore.case = T, all.files = T, full.names = T, recursive = T, pattern = ".R$") 

And/or from public github repo :

    paths <- codexplor::get_github_raw_filespath(repo = "tidyverse/readr", pattern = "\\.R")
    #  Return characters list of url of .R files from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/
    
‚è© **2. Read the files and get a citations network of func'.**


    net <- codexplor::get_text_network_from_files(paths, 
    regex_to_exclude_files_path = "test-", ignore_match_less_than_nchar = 5)
    # Return a data.frame, edgelist of the functions citations network

Assuming the user provide a list of files paths and/or url, `get_text_network_from_files()` will :

- read the files and extract a first pattern (e.g., with the defaults parameters a regex will extract R functions names as soon as they are defined within a file). 
- search for these pattern (functions names by default) in the contents of the files, in order to constitute a Citations Network - a 'directed' type of network.
- return the edgelist, with some filters (hereabove, we ask for exclude files that contain "test-" and the matches with less than 5 char from the edgelist, e.g., `cli()` will not be matched since it's a 3 letters function name). 

‚è© **3. Get a directed `igraph` network object.**

    netig <- codexplor::get_igraph_from_df(net) 
    # return a directed 'igraph' object from our edgelist

‚è© **4. Get an interactive `networkD3` HTML object**

    get_networkd3_from_igraph(netig) 
 
Return a list of 2 objects : 

1. a list named `'net3d'` with 2 data.frames, with the data used by `networkD3` (`'nodes'` and `'edges'`)

2. a networkD3::forceNetwork S3 class object named `'forcenetwork'`, an html interactive network dataviz'

You should play with the parameters, e.g., coloring nodes depending on their outdegrees :

     get_networkd3_from_igraph(netig, color_outdeg_instead_of_indeg = T)

‚è© **5. Get metrics and identifying cascading dependancies of func'**

There is several useful parameters to take care with, depending on the languages you have to manage. Default is for a R programming project.

<!--
> `codexplor` help you to manage and analyze a programming project, giving you tools to figure out the big picture and to find the little wrench in the (net)work. 

> **Usecases 1.** As a head of a dozens of persons (non-tech) team', I have to dev' actively on the long run. codexplor help me to get the big picture of a large programming project quickly, with instant metrics & insights. Thanks to the network analysis and dataviz', I have deep insights about the project, such as for identifying theoritical vulnerability, for choosing where to start a polishing loop, but also for following a programming project over the long run. 

> **Usecases 2.** I can show the network or a small part of the network to the dev' and tech' profiles during our meetings or event prez'.

> **Usecases 3.** codexplor add insights on a particular function, as an help for the dev' when it come back on a project after a while (e.g., list all the local dependancies of a function and the functions that call it as a local dependancy).

```{r example, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# library(codexplor)
## get a network of your func' in some R code files, excluding the test- from testthat
# get_text_network_from_files("~",   regex_to_exclude_files_path = "test-"
#                             , pattern = "\\b([A-Za-z0-9_\\.]+)(?=\\s*(?:<-)\\s*function)" ) #here we define a capture-regex for extracting the texte before '<- function'

```


```{r pressure, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# plot(pressure)

# In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

<!-- *Usecases of a quick programming project understanding*. codexplor goal is to *quickly* analyse your developing project, in order to *gain* time of comprehension, made your documentation, dataviz' of your project, etc. The features offered are crafted for coordinate large programming project, made helper func' for new colleagues and/or future you, formally identifying your higher-level func' and/or the most-frequently used as dependancies... and other handy features for priorizing your work by quickly figure out 'where' you have to pay attention. For example, before to change a parameter name in a func', you want to check what are the func' that used the one you want to modify. Same for changing the returned content or the behavior of a func' : you want to check which ones used this func' that you want to modify. You also want to offer an easy way to understand the chaining of your custom func'. -->
