`codexplor` offers R functions for explore and monitor a programming project : simply indicate your project(s) path(s) and get immediate insights with text-mining metrics, network analysis & dataviz'. Get rid of complexity with a broader perspective on the project !

## Installation
You can install the development version of codexplor with

``` r
devtools::install_github("clement-LVD/codexplor")
```

## Features
 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Method}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=Citations Network of internal dependencies&labelColor=black&color=green)
 
Given a programming project :

‚è©  Appreciate global complexity with a **Citations Network of internal dependencies**
    - Get network metrics & dataviz' about the functions defined in the project (e.g. explore global structure or zoom on major internal dependancies^[functions that are called by others functions of the project]).

‚è© Assess local complexity with **Text-mining metrics** *[WIP]* 
  - Get document-level metrics (e.g., files readability)

‚è© ...

 
Planned features : 
 ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Method}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=Text-mining metrics&labelColor=grey&color=orange)

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Export}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=Network-advanced&labelColor=grey&color=orange)

## Supported languages



Currently `codexplor` support the ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/R-yellow) programming language. 
Planned languages are : `r paste0(collapse = ", ", names(codexplor::function_def_regex_by_language()))`.

### Example : Explore your internal-dependancies with a Citations Network 

1. Given folders path(s) and/or github repo(s), get a Citations Network of the functions with   ![.](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Method}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get_text_network_from_project()&labelColor=yellow&color=black)

        net <-  get_text_network_from_project(repos = c("tidyverse/stringr", "clement-LVD/codexplor") )
        # Return a data.frame, edgelist of a citations network

2. Look an interactive dataviz' with `networkD3` : ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/{Dataviz}-bold?style=flat&logoColor=black&logoSize=2&label=get_networkd3_from_igraph()&labelColor=yellow&color=black)

       codexplor::get_networkd3_from_igraph(net) 
       
![](man/figures/example_net3d_dataviz.png)

Here, ingoing links are colorized, in order to reveal the functions used by others functions *aka* local dependancies of the project. e.g.,. we see that the most-common local dependancy inside the tidyverse/stringr repo is `compat-types-check.R`, and that some codexplor functions are relying on stringr:: functions.

Play with the parameters reveal others infos, e.g., you should try to color nodes accordingly to their outdegrees - the number of functions they call, in order to reveal the "high-level functions'.

`codexplor` offers several protocols & parameters to take care with. See the vignettes :

- Apply a precise text-analysis protocol, such as [turning your programming project into a text-network](../vignettes/Turn a programming project into a text-network)

- [Turn a programming project folder(s) into a corpus with construct_corpus()](../vignettes/construct_a_corpus)
- [Turn it into an igraph object, filter and manage it with helper functions](../vignettes/manage_igraph_object)

Depending on the languages you have to manage, you'll want to tweak the 'pattern' used for match a function definition. The user must be familiar with text-mining & network methods since - for now - `codexplor` only support the R programming language (other languages are planned). 

---


<!--
‚è© **4. Get an interactive `networkD3` HTML object**

 
`get_networkd3_from_igraph()` Return a list of 2 objects : 

1. a list named `'net3d'` with 2 data.frames, with the data used by `networkD3` (`'nodes'` and `'edges'`)

2. a networkD3::forceNetwork S3 class object named `'forcenetwork'`, an html interactive network dataviz'

‚è© *Get metrics and identifying problematic patterns (e.g., cascading dependancies of func')*

<!--
> `codexplor` help you to manage and analyze a programming project, giving you tools to figure out the big picture and to find the little wrench in the (net)work. 

> **Usecases 1.** As a head of a dozens of persons (non-tech) team', I have to dev' actively on the long run. codexplor help me to get the big picture of a large programming project quickly, with instant metrics & insights. Thanks to the network analysis and dataviz', I have deep insights about the project, such as for identifying theoritical vulnerability, for choosing where to start a polishing loop, but also for following a programming project over the long run. 

> **Usecases 2.** I can show the network or a small part of the network to the dev' and tech' profiles during our meetings or event prez'.

> **Usecases 3.** codexplor add insights on a particular function, as an help for the dev' when it come back on a project after a while (e.g., list all the local dependancies of a function and the functions that call it as a local dependancy).

```{r example, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# library(codexplor)
## get a network of your func' in some R code files, excluding the test- from testthat
# get_text_network_from_files("~",   regex_to_exclude_files_path = "test-"
#                             , pattern = "\\b([A-Za-z0-9_\\.]+)(?=\\s*(?:<-)\\s*function)" ) #here we define a capture-regex for extracting the texte before '<- function'

```


```{r pressure, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# plot(pressure)

# In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

<!-- *Usecases of a quick programming project understanding*. codexplor goal is to *quickly* analyse your developing project, in order to *gain* time of comprehension, made your documentation, dataviz' of your project, etc. The features offered are crafted for coordinate large programming project, made helper func' for new colleagues and/or future you, formally identifying your higher-level func' and/or the most-frequently used as dependancies... and other handy features for priorizing your work by quickly figure out 'where' you have to pay attention. For example, before to change a parameter name in a func', you want to check what are the func' that used the one you want to modify. Same for changing the returned content or the behavior of a func' : you want to check which ones used this func' that you want to modify. You also want to offer an easy way to understand the chaining of your custom func'. -->
